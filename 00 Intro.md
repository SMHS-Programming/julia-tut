# Introduction
Welcome to the tutorial for Julia, made by Ben Pang for the SMHS Programming Club of 2016-2017.

## The Julia toolkit

- [Open up an account on JuliaBox](juliabox.org) or [install Julia locally on your computer](http://julialang.org/downloads/). It is recommended that you do both so you can program at school _and_ familiarize yourself with the terminal.
- If you really want to, get [the Atom code editor](https://atom.io/) (installing [Juno](http://junolab.org/) after). If you _really_ want a challenge, install and learn [Vim](http://vim.org) or [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
- Get familiar with the [Julia docs](http://docs.julialang.org). Just make sure you know where everything is, what the important sections are, etc.
- Google is your friend. I'm not kidding; you'd be quite surprised to see the amount of beginners who give up on a programming task without using Google.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (and [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) in general) is a good place to get help. [PPCG.SE](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com) is a great place to practice if you're into/interested in code-golfing. (I happen to be a regular there, so you'll see me around.)

## So, what is Julia?
Julia is a scientific computing language that has a whole lot of other uses (robotics, web servers, etc.). It is a _really_ new language - an infant by programming language standards, as it was born circa 2011. For comparison, one of the oldest programming languages, Lambda Calculus, was proposed in the 1940s; most programming languages that we know today (C, C++, C#, Fortran, Haskell, Python, Javascript, etc.) were proposed in the 1970s to early 2000s.

If you have programmed in other languages, you will see with little effort that Julia is _fast_. Like, as fast as C. Which means that it's _really, really fast_. Why it's fast is for another time.

We will be learning it for several reasons.

1. To give you a solid foundation in programming to build on and expand. Julia implements some extremely important/useful programming concepts that you will need to learn at some point.
2. To make learning other languages much easier. Julia is built on Python, but takes inspiration from a bunch of other languages, especially in syntax.
3. Julia will make you better at math. After all, it is a scientific computing language. Which means that you will not only learn to love Julia, you will think of math in terms of Julia. Which means that you will be a nerd. Welcome to the club.

We suggest that you try learning ahead before/after each Programming Club meeting so that we can move much more quickly and get farther.
